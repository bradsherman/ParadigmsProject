Paradigms Final Project
=======================

Brad Sherman & Ben Dalgarn
--------------------------

This project is a multi-player game that utilizes the python PyGame and Twisted
libraries. The objective of the game is to protect the blocks behind your player
from the ball floating around on the screen. It is a spin-off from the classic
brick-breaker game.
